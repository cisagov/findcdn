`findcdn`, is a tool that can scan and detect the kind of
[Content Distribution Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
a domain uses. `findcdn` can save results to a file, be used as a module, or
just output to stdout.

`findcdn` helps users of the tool accurately determine what CDN a domain is
using. The list of supported domains is listed in the
[cdn_config.py](https://github.com/cisagov/findcdn/blob/develop/src/findcdn/cdnEngine/detectCDN/cdn_config.py)
file in the repository. The library can be implemented as a standalone tool or
an importable module in your project. In both cases, the results can be written
to an output file.

## Getting Started ##

`findcdn` requires **Python 3.7+**. Python 2 is not supported.

`findcdn`
can be installed as a module using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file in the
repository.

### Installed as a Module ###

`findcdn` can be installed via `pip`:

```console
pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```

It can then be run directly:

```console
findcdn list github.com
```

Alternatively you can install quickly to any project with:

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/cisagov/findcdn.git
```

**Note:** It is recommended to use a python virtual environment to install
modules and keep your environment clean. If you wish to do so, you will need
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and the
[pyenv-virtualenv plugin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) before
installing the module.

### Standalone Usage and Examples ###

```console
findcdn file <fileIn> [options]
findcdn list  <domain>... [options]
findcdn (-h | --help)

findcnd -h
findcdn file domains.txt -o output_cdn.txt -t 17 -d
findcdn list dhs.gov cisa.gov -o output_cnd.txt -v
findcdn list cisa.gov
```

#### Options ####

```console
  -h --help                    Show this message.
  --version                    Show the current version.
  -o FILE --output=FILE        If specified, then the JSON output file will be
                               created at the specified value.
  -v --verbose                 Includes additional print statements.
  --all                        Includes domains with and without a CDN
                               in output.
  -d --double                  Run the checks twice to increase accuracy.
  -t --threads=<thread_count>  Number of threads, otherwise use default.
  --timeout=<timeout>          Max duration in seconds to wait for a domain to
                               conclude processing, otherwise use default.
  --user_agent=<user_agent>    Set the user agent to use, otherwise
                               use default.
```

#### Sample Output ####

```console
user2@ubuntu:~$ findcdn list asu.edu -t 7 --double
Using 7 threads.
[Pending: 0 jobs]==[Threads: 2]: 100%|███████████████████████████████| 2/2 [00:00<00:00,  2.22it/s]
{
    "date": "06/19/2020, 13:00:38",
    "CDN_count": "1",
    "domains": {
        "asu.edu": {
            "IP": "'104.16.50.14'",
            "cdns": "'.cloudflare.com'",
            "cdns_by_names": "'Cloudflare'"
        }
    }
}
Domain processing completed.
1 domains had CDN's out of 1.

### Library Usage ###

Since `findcdn` can be installed as a module, its CDN detection power can be
called from and implemented in any project. First, import `findcdn` into your
project, as shown above. Then, pass it a list of domains to analyze. After
processing, the program will return a JSON object containing the inputted
domains and the CDNs they use.

The way `findcdn` functions is determined by the passed in options; the current
possible options and an example are written below for your convenience:

```python
findcdn.main(
    domain_list: List[str],  # List of domains to search
    output_path: str = None,  # if included, output results to JSON
    verbose: bool = False,  # Verbose mode (more printing!)
    all_domains: bool = False,  # Includes domains that dont have cdn's in the output
    interactive: bool = False,  # Includes a progress bar (normally used for command line)
    double_in: bool = False,  #D ouble the number of tries on a domain to increase accuracy
    threads: int = THREADS,  # Number of threads to use
    timeout: int = TIMEOUT,  # How long to wait on a domain
    user_agent: str = USER_AGENT,  # User Agent to use
)
```

#### Example ####

```python
import findcdn
import json

domains = ['google.com', 'cisa.gov', 'censys.io', 'yahoo.com', 'pbs.org', 'github.com']
resp_json = findcdn.main(domains, output_path="output.json", double_in=True, threads=23)

dumped_json = json.loads(resp_json)

for domain in dumped_json['domains']:
    print(f"{domain} has CDNs:\n {dumped_json['domains'][domain]['cdns']}")
```

## How It Works ##

`findcdn` is broken into three sections:

- findcdn's main runner file
  - Validates and organizes inputted domains
  - Orchestrates the use of the CDN Engine using a list of domains
  - Output domain CDN's in JSON to stdout and a file if selected
- The CDN Engine
  - Organizes all domains into a "pot"
  - `Chef` will use the CDN Detection library to obtain all CDNs for each domain
  - `Chef` then runs an analysis to set the boolean has_cdn value if it detects
    a domain is has a CDN then returns the list of domains to the runner file
- CDN Detection
  - Will scrape data from:
    - HTTPS Server Headers
    - CNAME records
    - WHOIS data
  - From each of these, it runs a fingerprint scan to identify any CDNs defined
    in `cdn_config.py`.

## History ##

This tool's original purpose was to automatically detect if a domain that uses a
CDN is frontable. Due to the significant overhead for fronting detection, we
pivoted the development of this tool to be exclusively a CDN *detection* tool.
We use our [wiki](https://github.com/cisagov/findcdn/wiki) to describe further
what Domain Fronting is, our research notes, design decisions, and playbooks for
fronting specific domains. If you find any additional frontable domains or any
flaws in the current playbooks, please consider [contributing!](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Project Change Summary ###

- The project is now for CDN *detection*.
  - Determining frontability was infeasible for every CDN provider.
- Resources, Notes, and playbooks are now available in the
  [wiki](https://github.com/cisagov/findcdn/wiki) of this repository.
- Any feedback, improvements, or additional playbooks are always appreciated.

## More Information ##

There is more information located
[on our wiki page](https://github.com/cisagov/findcdn/wiki). We encourage you to
make feature requests or [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md) anything you would like
to see added into the project or wiki.

This can be any of the following:

- Information pertaining to domain fronting
- Playbooks for fronting different domains
- Better detection methods for CDN
- General updates to current wiki pages
